# Hi, I'm Anthony Huang (Tony) üëã

I'm a **Graduate Researcher** at **Zhejiang University**, specializing in **Super-Resolution** and **Transformers** under the guidance of Prof. Zou in the **CAD Group Research**. I am deeply passionate about **deep learning**, **NLP**, and **computer vision**. My internship experiences at **Alibaba** and **J.P. Morgan** helped me develop expertise in **backend optimization**, **AI**, and **data management**.

## üîç What I Do
- **AI Research**: Exploring advanced techniques in **Super-Resolution**, **Transformers**, and **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**.
- **Machine Learning**: Developing systems using **Transformers**, **GANs**, and **Diffusion Models** for various applications.
- **Computer Vision**: Working on models for **image super-resolution**, **segmentation**, and **image generation**.

## üöÄ Current Projects
- **[Super-Resolution With Triple Attention](https://github.com/anthonyhuang19/Super-Resolution-With-Triple-Attention)**: Enhancing **image super-resolution** using a **Triple Attention Mechanism** for faster and more accurate results.  
- **[Adapting ESRGAN for Enhanced Super-Resolution](https://github.com/anthonyhuang19/Adapting-ESRGAN-for-Enhanced-Super-Resolution-Experiments)**: Exploring improvements to the **ESRGAN** architecture for better **super-resolution** performance.  
- **[GeoVis](https://github.com/anthonyhuang19/GeoVis-Advanced-Geometric-Visualization-and-Drawing-Tool)**: An advanced tool for visualizing and interacting with **geometric shapes** and **algorithms** to explore computational geometry.  
- **[ImageMosaic](https://github.com/anthonyhuang19/ImageMosaic)**: Working on **image mosaicking** and **homography estimation** to generate seamless panoramic images.  
- **[EdgeSeg](https://github.com/anthonyhuang19/EdgeSeg-Edge-Detection-and-Image-Segmentation)**: Developing **edge detection** and **image segmentation** algorithms to enhance image understanding.  
- **[TriAttNet](https://github.com/anthonyhuang19/TriAttNet)**: Creating a **Triple Attention Mechanism** for improving **image super-resolution** quality across channels, spatial regions, and global dependencies.  

## üõ† Skills
- **Languages**: Python, C/C++, Java, SQL  
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face  
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, AWS, Google Cloud
