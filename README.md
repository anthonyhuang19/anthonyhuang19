## üöÄ Selected Projects

- **[Film Summary RAG + LLM](#)**  
  *FastAPI, LangChain, Hugging Face, Google Vertex AI, Pinecone*  
  A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system combining sentence embeddings, a vector database (Pinecone), and large language models (LLMs) for semantic film summary queries. Embeddings are generated using Hugging Face models, while the final response is generated by a Google-hosted LLM served via FastAPI.

- **[Dynamic Price Optimizer](https://github.com/anthonyhuang19/)**  
  *Flask, React, PostgreSQL, Scikit-learn*  
  A full-stack ML-powered pricing system with a prediction model and interactive admin dashboard. Supports dynamic pricing adjustments based on data-driven insights.

- **[TriAttNet (Super-Resolution)](https://github.com/anthonyhuang19/TriAttNet)**  
  *PyTorch, Flask, React*  
  An advanced deep learning model for image super-resolution using a triple attention mechanism. Includes a backend API for model inference and a frontend for image comparison.

- **[Custom DNS Client/Server](https://github.com/anthonyhuang19/Custom-DNS-Client-and-Server-in-Python)**  
  *Python (Socket Programming)*  
  A low-level DNS client-server application with query caching and response handling. Future improvements include integrating AI-based DNS anomaly detection and dashboard analytics.

- **[Distributed Key-Value Store](https://github.com/anthonyhuang19/Distributed-Key-Value-Store-in-C++)**  
  *C++, Multithreading (Planned: gRPC, React)*  
  A high-performance, thread-safe distributed key-value store implemented in C++. Designed with scalability in mind, with plans to add gRPC support and a React-based UI for monitoring.
